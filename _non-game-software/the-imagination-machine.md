This is the project my team created as part of **MIT Reality Hack 2022**. It is a VR experience in which the user takes turns telling a story with GPT3. As they are going back and forth, telling their story, we use a combination of GPT3, CLIP, and a diffusion model to generate an image of the story, which we then show to the user.

With this project, my team won the award for **Cultural and Artistic Expression in the Metaverse**.
