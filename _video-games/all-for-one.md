This is a game I worked on as part of **CMS.611J/6.073 Creating Video Games** at MIT. For this assignment, we were asked to create a game meeting the theme of Spectation. In particular, our goal was to make games that would be interesting for spectators to watch and allowed quick understanding of what was happening and why.
