Hi everyone! My name is Jack. I like playing MMOs and hundred-hour RPGs, blasting an eclectic array of music, spinning lightsabers, shooting my friends with NERF guns, roleplaying deeply flawed characters, and GMing TTRPGs and LARPs.

I've been designing games in one form or another for basically my entire life. The first thing I can remember is trying to set up a LARP version of Wizard101 around my house when I was in elementary school. Since then, I took up DMing in middle school, started running LARP events in high school, and started designing my own video games at MIT.

I've been programming since elementary school, when I tried (and mostly failed) to make a Minecraft mod to add the magical metals from the Percy Jackson series. In middle school, I learned how to make basic websites with HTML, CSS, and PHP. In high school, I participated in ASU's Project App Maker Pro and built a Breakout-like game to teach musical chords. As part of my high school senior project, I recreated Pong, 2048, and Flappy Bird. At MIT, I started programming games I had designed myself.
